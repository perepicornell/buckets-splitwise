        The "4 transactions approach" explained:

        Combining every possible situation in Splitwise, for each SW expense
        there's a maximum of 4 transasctions that could happen in buckets.

        The BucketManager driver is made in a way that if you try to do a 0â‚¬
        amount transaction it will be ignored if it's the first time importing
        it, but if it detects that we already have it registered, then it will
        update the existing transactions and therefore turn them into 0â‚¬ ones.

        This system also solves:
        If after having changed, the expense needs a different combination
        of transactions.
        - If it needs less transactions than existing, we'll be passing all the
        rest anyway with 0â‚¬, so they will be updated.
          Example: It was a 1â‚¬ expense from payment + 24â‚¬ transfer to
          splitwise account, but now it should be only 1 expense of 25â‚¬
          to any of the accounts.
        - If it needs more transactions than existing, now it will include the
        amounts of the new transactions, therefore they will be created.
          Example: it was 1 transfer and now it should be 1 transfer
          + 1 expense from any of the accounts.

        With this system if an expense is modified in Splitwise in so many ways
        that goes through all the possible states, you might end up with a
        transaction for the right amount and 3 other transactions for 0â‚¬.
        At least that will give you a clue of what was going on but, more
        importantly, in order to fix this you should remember to cancel your
        friendship with whoever is messing it up with Splitwise so much.

        But more practically, just delete the 0â‚¬ Buckets' transactions after
        you verify that the expense details are finally correct in Splitwise.
